run `npm i` to install the node modules
run `npm run start` to see the app


instructions:

The app we're building lets users create themselves a profile for their favourite cat.
There are 3 cats to choose from and the user can build a list of foods their cat likes.


There are some tests that are failing currently because the functionality hasn't been built.

Add the necessary functionality to pass the tests.
- When the user selects their favourite cat it should display the corresponding image for the cat.
- Make it so you can enter a type of food your cat likes and have a list of foods rendered below.
- No cat image should be displayed when no cat has been selected.
- Make it so the CatProfile component can be passed a default selected cat

Additionally, style the form so it is centered horizontally on the page.
Make any other style adjustments you'd like to improve the look of the form.


can you prevent adding an empty food item?

can you prevent numbers being added?
